## Overview - Usage

This repository contains scripts used in the thesis of Paul Derkenne
This project involves the analysis of DNA 16S rRNA Illumina sequencing data, processed through the FROGS pipeline on the Galaxy portal of the French National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food, and the Environment (INRAE Jouy-en-Josas, France). 
The analysis aims to: (i) Create a Phyloseq object from the BIOM file (ii) Visualize the main distribution of phyla within the dataset (iii) Perform ordination analyses to explore the structure of microbial communities.
